**Thale** is a small, purely functional programming language with immutability, expression-based syntax, and powerful pattern matching. The language emphasizes clarity, safety, and functional purity.

---

## Getting Started
Create a new Thale script with the `.thl` extension. Here's a basic example:
```thl
use std.io

val main() {
    io.println("Hello, World!")
}
```
To build and run your script:
`thale run Main.thl`
